        <h3><u>Who are we ?</u></h3>

        <p>Basically, we are <b>students from different schools</b>, gathered to provide <u> from inside AND outside</u> other students from  the university,
            with services that they need and which we also happen to excel at. We have members from Design and Media, Ethical Hacking, Computer Science, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.
           <br> we help in building module-based projects for other students and we also built a graduation project for a group of member from outside our university.
